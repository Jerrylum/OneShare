### Feature

#### 1. Synchronization

It allows you to send the text entered on your phone directly to the `input field` or/and `clipboard` of your computer.  

For example, you can use `voice input of your phone` and then send the text `to your computer`. You will be able to use your phone's input method on your computer.

Don't forget, it supports UTF-8 message.

#### 2. Quick Connection Speed

It allows you to quickly connect your phone and computer. After that, you can start transferring data between devices.  

This program will set up a web server on your computer. You and your friends can scan the QR code on the screen to enter the chat room.  

Your friends do not need to install an application on their phones or computers, tell you their email address or phone number, they don't even have to buy a new iPhone.

Scan the QRcode and start typing your message.

#### 3. Offline Compatibility

It doesn't require the Internet to use.   

It's stupid when two computers are less than one meter apart and you have to upload your file to a remote server.  

Right now, as long as you are connected to the same network, you can share information with other devices without connecting to the Internet. Obviously, it works faster than Google Drive.

#### 4. Portability

Portable application. You can simply download it and start using it.  It perfectly supports computers with reborn cards at schools.
